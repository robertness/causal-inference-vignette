<ul><li><p>We next simulate an experiment to elucidate how dimensionality affects causal network inference
<p>We simulate data from a dependence network of 60 proteins and evaluate performance of structure inference algorithms in recovering the structure.
<p>We then simulate a second experiment where the number of proteins is increased 99, to see how the increased protein coverage affected performance.
<p>We varied depth as well as breadth -- In order to evaluate the effect of increasing sample size we start with 100 replicates, then repeat the two experiments with 200 replicates.
<p>We evaluate performance by counting the total number of false positives (reject conditional independence for two conditionally independent proteins) and true positives (correct rejections)
<p>We built the dependence structure using the simple case of variable triplets
<ul><li><p>Testing conditional independence requires at least three variables -- two to compare, and at least one variable upon which to condition.
<p>Thus we created triplets of Guassian variables A, B, and C
<ul><li><p>C has a normal distribution with 0 mean and variance 1 
<p>A and B were also created as 0 mean Gaussian variables with individual variance of 1 and covariance with C of .6
<p>A and B are conditionally independent of eachother given C.
<p>Thus for a triplet there are two edges, one from A to C and B to C, while the edge from A to B is missing.
</li>
</ul><p>Thus we created a network of 60 proteins with 20 triplets -- disjoint subnetworks with two edges each, 40 in total.
</li>
</ul><p>We examined two cases for expanding the number of measured proteins
<ul><li><p>The first describes the case of measuring proteins that provide no additional information about the biology.
<p><span style="font-family: SansSerif, sans-serif; ">We model this scenariao by &nbsp;adding 39 independently simulated proteins in the second experiment &nbsp;-- &nbsp;they are completely independent from anything else in the network such that concluding that an edge contained one of these nodes would be a false positive.</span>
<p>We then look at the case where more proteins are added, but the added proteins are informative about the biology.
<p>We model this by increasing the number of triplets from 20 to 33, again to 99 proteins in total.
